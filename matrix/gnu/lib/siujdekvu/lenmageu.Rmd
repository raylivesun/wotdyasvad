@Announcement Ping 

We have implemented a bot, @Astra which is ran by me and my branch server. This bot allows you to scan a user via one command and it checks if the user is logged in our scammer database or not. It has over 480+ scammers so far and we are hoping to expand it even further ðŸ˜‡

We offer 2 scans, user scan and server scan. Feel free to use these whenever youâ€™d like. The server is also ran by several staff members here too :))

Have a good one guys.

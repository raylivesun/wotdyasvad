Okay, here's a template for a `README.md` file specifically tailored for a project written in the R language. You'll need to replace the placeholder text (like `<Project Title>`, `<username>/<repo>`, etc.) with your specific project details.

```markdown
# <Project Title>

[![CRAN Status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/<PackageName>)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=<PackageName>) <!-- Optional: If on CRAN -->
[![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/<username>/<repo>/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/<username>/<repo>/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml) <!-- Optional: If using GitHub Actions -->
[![Codecov test coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/<username>/<repo>/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://app.codecov.io/gh/<username>/<repo>?branch=main) <!-- Optional: If using Codecov -->
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) <!-- Choose your license -->

<!-- One-liner description -->
A brief description of what this R project, package, or set of scripts does.

<!-- Longer description -->
More detailed explanation of the project's purpose, the problem it solves, and its key features or functionalities. Mention the target audience if applicable.

## Features

*   Feature 1 (e.g., Implements the XYZ statistical method)
*   Feature 2 (e.g., Provides functions for easy data visualization of type ABC)
*   Feature 3 (e.g., Includes a Shiny app for interactive exploration)
*   ...

## Installation

### Requirements

*   R version >= `<minimum.R.version>` (e.g., 4.0.0)
*   <!-- List any crucial system dependencies if applicable -->
    *   Example: `libcurl` development library (e.g., `sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu, `brew install curl` on macOS)

### Option 1: From CRAN (if applicable)

The stable version can be installed from CRAN:

```R
install.packages("<PackageName>")
```

### Option 2: Development Version from GitHub

The latest development version can be installed from GitHub using the `remotes` package:

```R
# install.packages("remotes") # Uncomment if you don't have remotes installed
remotes::install_github("<username>/<repo>")
```

### Option 3: For Script-Based Projects (if not a package)

Clone the repository and navigate into the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repo>.git
cd <repo>
```
*(Add any further setup instructions, e.g., setting working directory in R, sourcing setup scripts)*

## Usage

*(Provide clear examples of how to use your code. Tailor this section heavily based on whether it's a package, scripts, or a Shiny app.)*

### Example 1: Basic Package Usage (if it's a package)

Load the library and use a core function:

```R
# Load the library
library(<PackageName>)

# Example data (or load your own)
data <- data.frame(
  x = rnorm(100),
  y = rnorm(100)
)

# Example function call
result <- some_function(data$x, data$y)

# View results
print(result)
plot(result) # If plotting is supported
```

### Example 2: Running a Script (if it's scripts)

Explain how to run the main script(s), including any required arguments or input files.

```bash
# Example of running an R script from the command line
Rscript scripts/main_analysis.R --input data/raw_data.csv --output results/summary.txt --param1 value1
```

Or, if intended to be sourced within an R session:

```R
# Set working directory to the project root (if needed)
# setwd("/path/to/<repo>")

# Source the script
source("scripts/helper_functions.R")
source("scripts/main_analysis.R")

# Now run functions defined in the scripts
# results <- run_analysis("data/raw_data.csv")
```

### Example 3: Running a Shiny App (if applicable)

```R
# Load the library (if functions are packaged)
library(<PackageName>)

# Launch the app (assuming app.R is in the standard location or specified)
shiny::runApp("inst/shiny-app") # Adjust path as needed

# Or if the package has a launcher function:
# launch_my_app()
```

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following R packages:

*   `dplyr` (>= 1.0.0)
*   `ggplot2`
*   `data.table`
*   `<package name>`
*   ...

*(For packages, users can typically see this in the DESCRIPTION file, but listing key ones here is helpful. For scripts, this is essential.)*

These will usually be installed automatically if you install the package using `install.packages` or `remotes::install_github` (if listed correctly in the `DESCRIPTION` file's `Imports` or `Depends` fields).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`).
3.  Make your changes.
4.  <!-- Optional: Add instructions for developers -->
    *   Document new functions using `roxygen2` (`#' @param ...`).
    *   Add unit tests using `testthat` in the `tests/testthat/` directory.
    *   Ensure your code passes `R CMD check` locally.
    *   Consider styling your code using `styler` or following the tidyverse style guide.
5.  Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`).
6.  Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature-name`).
7.  Create a new Pull Request.
